## Introduction
CodeScout addresses a major challenge faced by large organizations: finding and reusing existing code that aligns with custom technical practices. As repositories grow, developers often struggle to locate the right pieces of code efficiently. CodeScout solves this by enabling semantic search of function definitions and code snippets across multiple repositories, using advanced NLP models to return the most relevant results based on natural language queries. 

With its robust CLI tool and a VSCode extension, CodeScout integrates directly into the development environment, promoting a faster, more intuitive workflow. It supports multiple programming languages and leverages embeddings to ensure accurate, contextually appropriate search results.

---

## System Architecture
1. **Repository Analysis**: CodeScout processes multiple repositories, extracting relevant source files to focus on key areas that need to be indexed for search.
   
2. **Code Splitting**: The code is divided into atomic units, primarily functions, to ensure that search queries return meaningful, concise results.

3. **Embedding Generation**: These atomic parts are passed through **Google's Gemma2b LLM** model, which generates detailed descriptions of each code segment. The descriptions are converted into embeddings—dense numerical vectors that capture the semantics of the code.

4. **Vector Database (ChromaDB)**: The embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**, a vector database optimized for fast, scalable retrieval. It allows CodeScout to quickly compare the query embeddings with the stored code embeddings and return the most relevant code snippets.

5. **Search & Retrieval**: When a developer makes a natural language query, it is also converted into embeddings, and the system uses cosine similarity to find the closest match in the database.

---

## How to Use

### CLI Tool
1. **Embedding Generation**:
   ```bash
   ./codescout --embed <repository-path>
   ```
   This will generate embeddings for all functions in the repository.

2. **Search Code Snippets**:
   ```bash
   ./codescout --search "<natural language query>"
   ```
   This will return the most relevant code snippets from the repository.

### VSCode Extension
Once installed, you can use the **CodeScout** extension directly within your VSCode editor. Open the extension, enter your natural language query, and it will search the connected repositories for relevant code snippets.

## Business Value
CodeScout provides measurable improvements in developer productivity and onboarding efficiency. On average, developers spend **40-60% of their time** searching for and understanding code. With CodeScout, this time is reduced by up to **35%**, saving valuable time, effort, and resources. The tool also ensures **enhanced adherence to organizational coding standards**, resulting in fewer code review cycles and better code quality.

- **Increased Efficiency**: Reduced search time allows developers to focus more on building new features.
- **Cost Savings**: By reducing onboarding time and improving code reuse, organizations can save costs on training and development.
- **Faster Development Cycles**: CodeScout speeds up development cycles by ensuring easy retrieval of reusable code.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Support for More Programming Languages**: Expand language support beyond the existing ones.
- **Advanced Query Processing**: Use more advanced NLP models for deeper context understanding.
- **Code Refactoring Suggestions**: Provide suggestions for code refactoring based on organization’s guidelines.
- **Cloud Integration**: Offer hosted solutions for large-scale, distributed repositories.
